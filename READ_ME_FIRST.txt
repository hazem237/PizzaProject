Welcome to the pizza machine program ^_^
Here are some notes about the project :
1) To start the program from A to Z
 ,all you have to do is press Run to Class JavaProject that contains main

2) As for the user interface, you have a very nice interface 
in addition to a menu that you can watch to help you choose
the type of pizza (also a very good design)

3) The program is linked to a database by XAMPP
, It sends the data every time seamlessly 
to the database spreadsheet (pizza).
Note: Apache and SQL must be activated in order 
to connect with "phpmyadmin "

4) The program contains a logger file,
 and every movement is immediately monitored
 and recorded inside the file so that the user 
can understand all the steps through different times

5) The program also records the data of each order 
in a file (output) in a folder (file_IO_Bounus)

Let's not linger, Enjoy in our great Pizza Machine !!!
